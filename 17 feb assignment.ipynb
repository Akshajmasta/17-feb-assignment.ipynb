    ". MongoDB is a cross-platform, document-oriented NoSQL database that uses a flexible schema to store and manage data. Unlike SQL databases, non-relational databases like MongoDB store data in a non-tabular format, using documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or other structures. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability, as data can be easily added or removed without requiring changes to the database schema. MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where data is unstructured or semistructured, or when the ability to scale horizontally is critical."

    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document database used to store, manage and retrieve data. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-based data model: MongoDB stores data as documents, which are similar to JSON objects. This provides a flexible schema and allows for easy mapping between objects in code and the data stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic schema: MongoDB has a dynamic schema, which means that documents can have different structures and fields can be added or removed as needed. This makes it easy to evolve the database schema as your application evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "High scalability and performance: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers, allowing for high scalability and performance. It also has built-in support for sharding and replication, which helps distribute data across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich query language: MongoDB supports a rich query language, including support for complex queries, aggregation, and full-text search. This makes it easy to retrieve the data you need quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing and aggregation capabilities: MongoDB has powerful indexing and aggregation capabilities, allowing for efficient queries and real-time analytics. It also supports geospatial indexing and search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in replication and sharding: MongoDB has built-in support for replication and sharding, making it easy to distribute data across multiple servers and ensure high availability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic failover and load balancing: MongoDB has built-in support for automatic failover and load balancing, which ensures high availability and performance even in the event of server failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secure by default: MongoDB is designed with security in mind, and includes built-in support for authentication and authorization, as well as encryption of data in transit and at rest.\n",
